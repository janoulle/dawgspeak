Another frontend for the service here: http://www.english.uga.edu/def/.

I don't own the content; I'm just providing a different (hopefully, nicer. :)) way of accessing the content and I'm hoping to extend it by
including other metadata about the words/phrases found online.

TODO
====
Since I've saved the content on http://www.english.uga.edu/def/ into word, type and definition in a MySQL database,
I'd like to do some sort of data visualization on the data e.g. group by frequency of certain words, etc.

I'll upload the Java program that does the work of parsing the data from a file saved on disk and uploads to a database.
