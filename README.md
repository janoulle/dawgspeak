DawgSpeak
=========

Another frontend for the service here: http://www.english.uga.edu/def/.

I don't own the content; I'm just providing a different (hopefully, nicer. :)) way of accessing the content and I'm hoping to extend it by including other metadata about the words/phrases found online.

NOTES
====

1. https://github.com/janoulle/DawgSpeakParser contains the Java program used to parse the content at http://www.english.uga.edu/def/. The Java program uses Jsoup to parse the html and spits out JSON file (results.json) which is used for the typehead and grabbing the word definition.
2. This repo contains the code powering my site at http://apps.janeullah.com/dawgspeak/.
